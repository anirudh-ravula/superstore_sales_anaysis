# Superstore Sales Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creating interactive dashboards in Power BI for a Superstore dataset. The objective is to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, product performance, and regional performance. The final output includes detailed visualizations suitable for business presentations and reports.
